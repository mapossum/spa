##Meeting 2 – Looping, Branching and Functions
####Today we will discuss a number of topics related to logical flow of a computer program.  The lecture notes are outlined below:

1. Review of variables, operators, data types and functions
  1. Introduce new operator (mod or modulus).
2. Logical operators that are useful in computer science:
  1. Branching and looping
3. Conditionals 
  1. Boolean Expressions
  2. Logical Operators
  3. Branching:
    1. Conditional Execution
    2. Alternative Execution
    3. Nested and Chained Conditions
4. Looping
  1. For Statement (More next week)
  2. While Statement
    1. Multiple assignment
    2. Updating Variables
5. More On Return Values (Fruitful Functions)
  1. Return statement
    1. Dead code
  2. Incremental Development
  3. Composition
  4. Boolean Functions
6. Keyboard Input – (5.11)

#Lab Assignment
##Exercise #2 – Making Decisions and Looping

####Do the following assignments:

1. If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, it is clear that you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:

  * "If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, you can."

  * Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and that prints either "Yes" or "No," depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths.

  * Write a program that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers, and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.  The user must be told if the three sticks form a triangle in a complete sentance.

2. The function for calculating the distance between two points is given in the book (page 53).  Using this function, write a program that calculates the length of a polyline (a number of connected line segments).  Use a while loop to continually prompt the user to enter a new vertex along a line.  Each time the user should be asked if the polyline is complete.  If it is complete report the length of the line.

3. Calculating distances on a spheroid is different that the Cartesian coordinates.  Use the haversine function (part of this download, on next page) and modify the program from #2 to calculate the length of line along a sphere.

Please turn them in by uploading them on Canvas. 

Name the script W_X_Y_Z.py 

where :
* W is your last name, 
* X is your first name, 
* Y is the Exercise number (in this case 1) and 
* Z is the script number (the first is 1 then second is 2 and so on).  

Thus for the first script to turn in, I would name the file Raber_George_2_1.py. and 
Raber_George_2_2.py. For the second file and Raber_George_2_3.py.

You will turn in 3 scripts for this exercise.
