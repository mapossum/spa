**Course Description:**

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of Python programming and its application in solving spatial problems using the ArcGIS Python library (ArcPy). Students will learn to automate geoprocessing tasks, analyze spatial data, and develop custom tools for geographic analysis.

**Prerequisites:** Basic computer literacy and familiarity with GIS concepts.

**Software:** 
* Python 3.x
* ArcGIS with ArcPy


**Course Objectives:** Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand fundamental programming concepts using Python.
* Apply Python programming to automate geoprocessing tasks.
* Utilize ArcPy to manipulate and analyze spatial data.
* Develop custom scripts and tools for geographic problem-solving.
* Apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a spatial context.


**Assessment:**

* Weekly assignments (40%)
* Midterm exam (30%)
* Final project (30%)
