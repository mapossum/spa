#Lab Assignment
For this assignment you will simply do all exercises found at the end of Chapter 2.  Then you will complete the following scripts:

1. Write a script that starts by assigning the variable r a number and then uses python to calculate the volume of a sphere with that radius.  Finally it uses the print function to print the value of that volume.  
2. Write another script that starts by assigning 4 variables floating point numbers that represents two sets of x and y coordinates.  Then use python to calculate the distance between the two points.  Finally use the print function to report the distance between the two points.    



You should make sure your understand the terms in the glossary that we discussed in class.
