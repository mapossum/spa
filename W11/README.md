#Lab Assignment
##Exercise #5 � Pandas

####Do the following assignment:

1. Complete the exercises on the Notebooks from the lecture (This time cut and paste each one into a text file and upload as part of your submission). 


Please turn them in by using Canvas.

You will turn in 3 scripts for this exercise.


We will also work on the following problem, but perhaps not until next week. In the included dataset there is a featureclass that contains the beginings of an map accuracy assessment.  You will finish up a notebook called "Lab Starter."  In this notebook you need to caculate the overall accuracy of the map (The sum of the diagonals of the crosstab matrix, introduced in class)
