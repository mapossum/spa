#Lecture
##Week 9 - Working with Raster Data
#### Raster GIS Data Processing using Python
###### Today we will discuss how to use arcpy to manipulate raster data


1. Review of raster operations:
  1. Local
  2. Neighborhood
  3. Zonal and Global
2. Very useful functions
  1. Con (conditional statement) basically an if-then statement.
  2. Arithmetic operations
  3. IsNull (assigns a no data value to an area)
3. arcpy.sa
  1. You can run every spatial anaylsis function in python
  2. WATCH OUT: arcpy.env extent and cell size usually need to be set or results won't be right (Also watch out for No Data)
  3. eval function (for putting together large functions)
  4. save function (for saving output results)
  5. Raster function (for turning text paths into rasters)
  6. arcpy.RasterToNumPyArray and arcpy.NumPyArrayToRaster
